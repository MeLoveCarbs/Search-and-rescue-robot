## Search and rescue project for our final project 

## Hardware used
Raspberry pi acting as master control
Arduino acting as motor node
RPLIDAR to map surrounding areas

## Software used
C in arduino for motor control
hector_slam library for mapping algorithm
ROS in linux for wireless robot control

### Please take a look at our [report](https://github.com/MeLoveCarbs/Search-and-rescue-robot/blob/master/Final%20Report%2002-01-01.docx) to understand more about the features of what our miniature search and rescue robot can do!
